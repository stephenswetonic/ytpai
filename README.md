# SentenceMixer AI

A free, anonymous tool for sentence mixing audio and video! Think Youtube poop or SFM style without manual editing.
Voice analysis done via Vosk AI models in the cloud. My goal is to keep this free to use and without registration.
Drag on drop doesn't really work on mobile. I may create a different UI for mobile.
